## [Mushroom Risotto](https://hellskitchenrecipes.com/mushroom-risotto/)

### Notes:
#### Ingredients:
Only use half the stock suggested (can be vegetable or chicken).<br>
Add ~40/50g porcini mushrooms (or other wild dried mushrooms as available).<br>
Use as much risotto as your pan allows - but remember it will need stirring!<br>
Experiment with different mushrooms!<br>
Use dried parsley for ease.<br>
Use nutritional yeast instead of parmesan.

#### Method:
Soak dried mushrooms in enough boiling water to replace the stock.<br>
Add fresh mushrooms in along with garlic, having chopped them relatively small.<br>
Use the liquid from the dried mushrooms as stock, adding additional stock if required. Add dried mushrooms along with the last bits of stock.<br>
Add dried parsley ~5 mins before the end to give it time to moisten, and add nutritinal yeast a little after, as well as as a topping.

## [Colombian Black Bean Stew](https://thelittleplantation.co.uk/blog/colombian-black-bean-stew)

### Notes:
#### Ingredients:
Option to include a grilled red pepper/rustic bread on the side instead of avocado.<br>
Use 2 cans of black beans and double spices.

#### Method:
Add ginger with garlic.<br>
Add chilli flakes towards end of cooking. <br>
Begin cooking rice just before beans go in.<br>
If there's time, soak/boil the black beans first to soften them.<br>
Don't add the spices stright after the beans, stir and then leave the beans for a little.<br>
Add some salt with the onions to begin.
